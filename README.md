# MFEStatic

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.5.
This project was built to show the "static" integration of a module created in the mfe1 project in the shell project that act as a host for the module.
The project uses Angular Module Federation and can be used as a starting point to explore the possibilities offered by this technology.

## Development server

Run `npm run run:all` for a dev server. Both mfe1 and shell will start and navigating through links you can see the micro frontend integration

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
